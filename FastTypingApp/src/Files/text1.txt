Computers have taken over our lives. People could not function without them, our electricity is run by computers, the government could not function without computers, and there are many others. Hackers are people who illegally gain access to, and sometimes tamper with, information in a computer system. Due to recent media coverage and corporate interest, hacker's activities are now looked down on by society as criminals. Despite the growing trend of hacking, very little research has been done on the hacking world and its culture. The image of a computer hacker has grown from a harmless nerd into a vicious techno-criminal. In reality most hackers are not out to destroy the world. The hackers in today's society are not just board teenagers. Since the introduction of personal computers in the 1970's, the art of computer hacking has grown along with the changing roles of computers in society.
